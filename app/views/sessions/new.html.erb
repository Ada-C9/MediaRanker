<h4>A note about logging in</h4>
<p>
	There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever that you are who you say you are. There's nothing special about users - username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep track of.

	We'll learn more about security and authentication in the next couple weeks. For now, don't worry about it beyond what you can see here.
