  <h4>A note about logging in</h4>
  <p>
    There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever
    that you are who you say you are. There's nothing special about users -
    username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep
    track of.

  <p>
    We'll learn more about security and authentication in the next couple weeks.
    For now, don't worry about it beyond what you can see here.
